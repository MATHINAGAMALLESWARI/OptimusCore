Description

As a Business user,
I want a consolidated list of errors in French documents and endorsements,
So that corrections can be reviewed and implemented accurately.

Endorsement 21B (Non-Covered Section)

 

AC1) Need to Update logic for Endorsement 21B (French + English):

Coverage display logic—if a physical damage coverage is selected, other columns should be blank; if none are selected, "non couvert" ("not covered") should be shown for all. Same rule applies to English version. 

AC2) Quote & Bind documents should have the same behavior.

Quote and Bind documents show Group in English instead → Groupe in French.

ENDT 21b does not print the French for 'Group' - Screenshot attached in Policy document 21 B

AC4) Endorsement 27 & 27A & Endorsement 4A and 4B - Free Form Field Mapping Issue 

Freeform text entered in French (on the Fleet Summary screen) is being replaced by abbreviations (e.g., "vehicule de tourist" becomes "PPV"); mapping logic needs to be fixed so entered text prints as-is for both French and English. Endorsements 4A & 4B  to ensure text input is printed as is.

Quote & Bind - last column for DCPD should be blank if not selected.

AC5) All free form endorsements, whatever User enters to print in English or French

Note : Document errors to be checked for forms FAQ 2, FAQ 8 and 30 as well
